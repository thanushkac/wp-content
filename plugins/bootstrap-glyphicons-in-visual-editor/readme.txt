Adds the Glyphicons included with Twitter Bootstrap 3 to the WordPress visual editor.

== Description ==

Adds the Glyphicons included with Twitter Bootstrap 3 to the WordPress visual editor. All credit goes to those 2 places for their awesome work! I just loved the Glyphicons with Bootstrap so much and wanted a way to insert them into posts if I felt like it. I figured others might want the same functionaily.

Instructions for use:

Method A (Visual Editor - Preferred):

1. Edit/Add any Page or Post

2. In the visual editor you will see a new bright red "G" button. Click the button

3. You will now be presented with a selection menu.

4. Simply select any icon and the shortcode will be placed into your post/page!


Method B (Manual Shortcode):
Insert shortcode into your post.
`[glyphicons icon="iconname"]`


 Method C (Manual into Theme):
Since this loads the necessary fonts and css for the Glyphicons you may put them anywhere using the standardized code:
`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-iconname"></span>`
